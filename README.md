# HomeSecurity
This repo contains the software used to run my current indoor home security system.

--This code is written in python 3.x in a linux environment (Raspberry Pi)

--The camera is triggered by a motion sensor connected to the RP's GPIO pins. This triggers the camera to search and capture human outline in frame and send the notifications (email/text with images). The cameras live feed is on 24/7 and can be accessed via Remote/SSH.

--The hardware includes: Raspberry Pi 3 Model B+, Raspberry Pi Ribbon Powered NightVision Camera(any will work), TP-LINK POE Splitter,  Symbol 802.3 POE, 3 Ethernet Cat6 cables, Raspberry Pi Motion Sensor(any will work), GPIO Female/Male cables, 16GB microSD card
